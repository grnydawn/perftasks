requried claw tasks
- claw wrapper: run claw command in script
- claw annotator : add claw directives and clauses

[optimization]
- fortran parser: reuse fparser2 task
- search space generator : generate a set of claw annotations
- kernel runner : run generated code and collect metrics


[steps]
1. prepare app: source files and commands to clean/build/run
2. survey app to know where to annotate with claw directives and clauses
3. create a search space and drive a opt search with a cycle of:
  3.1 select a set of source locations for claw-annotations
  3.2 select claw annotation per each locations
  3.3 generate new source by running claw
  3.4 run the generated code and collect metrics
  3.5 report this cycle and return to 3.1
